We're going to build an application that reads a set of contain configurations from a YAML file, checks the configuration against some security policy, produces warnings if there are any policy violations, otherwise deploys the containers to Docker.

Other possible things depending on time:
 - Polling for health
 - Deploying to other container runtimes
 - Configuration from another source
